        To hire RaidGuild, the first step is to schedule a paid consultation.
        After paying, our raiders will study any info, specs, docs and assets
        sent through this form and get in touch within 48 hours to schedule a
        date and time. The consultation itself lasts around 45 minutes and in it
        we will assess the challenges and discuss possible solution paths for
        your project.

        The amazing variety of projects that get in touch made us realize that
        we canâ€™t promise a defined deliverable from this process. For some, the
        consultation itself can be a round of troubleshooting. For others, it
        can be an initial discussion on the viability of an idea.

        In all cases we strive to understand how is it that RaidGuild, with all
        the expertise available, can better help your vision. And when possible
        deliver a proposal for at least a milestone, with clear timeline, work
        and cost involved.

        The funds go, in a small part, to the DAO, and the rest goes to the
